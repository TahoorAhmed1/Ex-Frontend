      "The American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) event was amazing! We spent 7 days in Wilmington Ohio at the World Equestrian Center for the Buckeye Classic horse show and we along with the AQHA were able to raise several thousand dollars to help veterans in need. 33 states and 5 countries were competing in the event so the exposure we got for our Vietnam vets was huge! Expedition Orange, working with the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) were able to identify two Vietnam veterans from southern Ohio who are currently suffering from Agent Orange exposure and because of the veteran’s fundraiser at the Buckeye Classic, we were able to present them each with a check for $1000. These two heroes were amazing men and Kenny, Gus and I were so proud to get these two veterans some assistance. We have much more planned over the next couple months and I will be letting you know what is happing as these events draw nearer. Thank you all for your continued support! Kenny, Gus and I look forward to meeting you all at some point on the trail!",
