      "My dad, Clifford Romberger, served in Vietnam from November 1970-November 1971. While in Vietnam, he was stationed at Da Nang Air Base and served with the 366th Tactical Fighter Wing “Gunfighters.” Forty years after he returned home from Vietnam he was diagnosed with a rare brain disease known as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in which the Veterans Administration (VA) determined was caused by exposure to Agent Orange. In 2015 my Dad passed away with my sister, my mom and me by his side. Never once did my Dad regret his service to our country. He served with pride until the day he passed away. A true patriot, friend, and best father a son could ever ask for.",

      "My dad, Jack Niedermeyer served in Vietnam from 1965 to 1966, he served in Da Nang, and was exposed to Agent Orange, however he did not know the consequences of the exposure. In 2003 he was diagnosed with a Glioblastoma multiforme, brain cancer in his left temporal lobe, it is a very aggressive cancer and terminal, He died 7 months after being diagnosed. He died June 23,2004. He never talked about his Vietnam service, and I am sure when he came back he was never recognized for his time in Vietnam as they were not treated very nice when they came home, My dad took me to visit the wall with our family in 1985 in D.C. he cried for his fallen friends who he served with and did not make it out alive. There are many of our Vietnam Veterans who have had this type of brain cancer (glioblastoma multiforme and have died the VA needs to recognize this cancer for our veterans and put it on the presumptive list!!!",
